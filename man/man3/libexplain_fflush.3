.SH NAME
libexplain_fflush \- explain fflush(3) errors

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/fflush.h>
.br
const char *libexplain_fflush(FILE *fp);
.br
const char *libexplain_errno_fflush(int errnum, FILE *fp);
.br
void libexplain_message_fflush(char *message, int message_size, FILE *fp);

void libexplain_message_errno_fflush(char *message, int message_size,
int errnum, FILE *fp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These function may be used to obtain explanations for
\f[I]fflush\fP(3) errors.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_fflush
const char *libexplain_fflush(FILE *fp);
.PP
The libexplain_fflush function may be used to obtain a human readable
explanation of what went wrong in a \f[I]fflush\fP(3) system call.  The
least the message will contain is the value of \f[CR]strerror(errno)\fP,
but usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
more detail.
.PP
The error number will be picked up from the \f[I]errno\fP global variable.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (fflush(fp))
{
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', libexplain_fflush(fp));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.ft R
.fi
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fflush\fP(3) system call.
.TP
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_errno_fflush
const char *libexplain_errno_fflush(int errnum, FILE *fp);
.PP
The libexplain_errno_fflush function may be used to obtain a human
readable explanation of what went wrong in a \f[I]fflush\fP(3)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CR]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much better, and
indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (fflush(fp))
{
    int err = errno;
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', libexplain_errno_fflush(err, fp));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtain from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called.  This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fflush\fP(3) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_message_fflush
void libexplain_message_fflush(char *message, int message_size, FILE *fp);
.PP
The libexplain_message_fflush function may be used to obtain a human
readable explanation of what went wrong in a \f[I]fflush\fP(3)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CR]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will do much better, and
indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The error number will be picked up from the \f[I]errno\fP global variable.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (fflush(fp))
{
    char message[3000];
    libexplain_message_fflush(message, sizeof(message), fp);
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', message);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe.
.TP
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fp\fP
The original fp, exactly as passed to the \f[I]fflush\fP(3) system call.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
Given a suitably thread safe buffer, this function is thread safe.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------

int errnum, FILE *fp);
