libexplain_link \- explain link(2) system call errors
.XX "libexplain_link(3)" "explain link(2) system call errors"
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/link.h>
.br
const char *libexplain_link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
.br
const char *libexplain_errno_link(int errnum, const char *oldpath,
const char *newpath);

.br
void libexplain_message_errno_link(char *message, int message_size, int errnum,
const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function docuemnted here may be used to
obtain explanations of link(2) system call errors .
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_link
const char *libexplain_link(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
.PP
The libexplain_link function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.  The least the
message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (link(oldpath, rewpath) < 0)
{
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', libexplain_link(oldpath, newpath));
    exit(1);
}
.ft P
.fi
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]oldpath\fP
The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]newpath\fP
The original newpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_errno_link
const char *libexplain_errno_link(int errnum, const char *oldpath,
const char *newpath);
.PP
The libexplain_errno_link function is used to obtain an explanation of
an error returned by the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.  The least the
message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.

This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (link(oldpath, newpath) < 0)
{
    int err = errno;
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', libexplain_errno_link(err, oldpath,
        newpath));
    exit(1);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from the \f[I]errno\fP
global variable just before this function is called. This is necessary
if you need to call \f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be
explained and this function, because many libc functions will alter the
value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]oldpath\fP
The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
.tP 8n
\f[I]newpath\fP
The original newpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared by all
libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in their argument
list.  This will be overwritten by the next call to any libexplain
function which shares this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it shares a return
buffer across all threads, and many other functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_message_link
void libexplain_message_link(char *message, int message_size,
const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
.PP
The libexplain_message_link function is used to obtain an explanation
of an error returned by the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.  The least the
message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually it
will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain the error value
to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
following example:
.RS
.ft CR
.nf
if (link(oldpath, newpath) < 0)
{
    char message[3000];
    libexplain_message_link(message, sizeof(message), oldpath,
        newpath);
    fprintf(stderr, '%s\n', message);
    exit(1);
}
.ft P

.TP 8n
\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.  Because a message
return buffer has been supplied, this function is thread safe.
.tP 8n
\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to store the returned message.
.TP 8n
\f[I]oldpath\fP
The original oldpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
\f[I]newpath\fP
The original newpath, exactly as passed to the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.

.SS libexplain_message_errno_link
void libexplain_message_errno_link(char *message, int message_size, int errnum,
const char *oldpath, const char * newpath);
.PP
The libexplain_message_errno_link function is used to obtain an
explanation of an error returned by the \f[I]link\fP(2) system call.
The least the message will contain is the value of strerror(errnum), but
usually it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in
