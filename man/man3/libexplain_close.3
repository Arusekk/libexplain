.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libexplain/close.h>
.sp 0.3
const char *libexplain_close(int fildes);
.br
const char *libexplain_errno_close(int errnum, int fildes);

void libexplain_message_close(char *message, int message_size, int fildes);

int errnum, int fildes);
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions may be used to obtain explanations for
errors returned by the \f[I]close\fP(2) system call.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_close
const char *libexplain_close(int fildes);
.PP
The \f[B]libexplain_close\fP function is used to obtain an explanation of an
error returned by the \f[I]close\fP(2)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the
value of \f[CW]strerror(errno)\fP, but usually it will
do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more
detail.
.PP
The \f[I]errno\fP global variable will be used to obtain
the error value to be decoded.
.PP
This function is intended to be used in a fashion
similar to the following example:
.RS
.ft CW
.nf
if (close(fildes) < 0)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", libexplain_close(fildes));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]close\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is
shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a
buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten
by the next call to any libexplain function which shares
this buffer, including other threads.
.PP
\f[B]Note:\fP
This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it
shares a return buffer across all threads, and many other
functions in this library.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS libexplain_errno_close
const char *libexplain_errno_close(int errnum, int fildes);
.PP
The \f[B]libexplain_errno_close\fP function is used to obtain
an explanation of an error returned by the \f[I]close\fP(2)
system call.  The least the message will contain is the value of
\f[CW]strerror(errnum)\fP, but usually it will do much better, and

if (close(fildes) < 0)
{
    int err = errno;
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\en", libexplain_close(err, fildes));
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
.fi
.ft R
.RE
.TP 8n
\f[I]errnum\fP
The error value to be decoded, usually obtained from
the \f[I]errno\fP global variable just before this
function is called.  This is necessary if you need to call
\f[B]any\fP code between the system call to be explained
and this function, because many libc functions will alter
the value of \f[I]errno\fP.
.TP 8n
\f[I]fildes\fP
The original fildes, exactly as passed to the \f[I]close\fP(2) system call.
.TP 8n
Returns:
The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is
shared by all libexplain functions which do not supply a
buffer in their argument list.  This will be overwritten
by the next call to any libexplain function which shares
this buffer, including other threads.

This function is \f[B]not\fP thread safe, because it
shares a return buffer across all threads, and many other
functions in this library.

\f[I]message\fP
The location in which to store the returned message.
If a suitable message return buffer is supplied, this
function is thread safe.

\f[I]message_size\fP
The size in bytes of the location in which to
store the returned message.
