/**
  * The libexplain_unlink function is used to obtain an explanation
  * of an error returned by the unlink(2) system call.  The least the
  * message will contain is the value of strerror(errno), but usually
  * it will do much better, and indicate the underlying cause in more
  * detail.
  *
  * The errno global variable will be used to obtain the error value to
  * be decoded.
  *
  * This function is intended to be used in a fashion similar to the
  * following example:
  * @code
  * if (unlink(pathname) < 0)
  * {
  *     fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", libexplain_unlink(pathname));
  *     exit(1);
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * @param pathname
  *     The original pathname, exactly as passed to the unlink(2) system call.
  * @returns
  *     The message explaining the error.  This message buffer is shared
  *     by all libexplain functions which do not supply a buffer in
  *     their argument list.  This will be overwritten by the next call
  *     to any libexplain function which shares this buffer, including
  *     other threads.
  * @note
  *     This function is <b>not</b> thread safe, because it shares a
  *     return buffer across all threads, and many other functions in
  *     this library.
