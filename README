NAME
       libexplain - Explain errno values returned by libc functions

DESCRIPTION
       The libexplain package provides a library which may be used to explain
       Unix and Linux system call errors.  This will make your application's
       error messages much more informative to your users.

       The library is not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror(3), but it
       comes close.  Each system call has a dedicated libexplain function, for
       example
              fd = open(path, flags, mode);
              if (fd < 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", libexplain_open(path, flags, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }
       If, for example, you were to try to open no-such-dir/some-file, you
       would see a message like
              open(pathname = "no-such-dir/some-file", flags = O_RDONLY)
              failed, No such file or directory (2, ENOENT) because there is
              no "no-such-dir" directory in the current directory

       The good new is that for each of these functions there is a wrapper
       function, in this case libexplain_open_or_die(3), that includes the
       above code fragment.  Adding good error reporting is as simple as using
       a different, but similarly named, function.  The library also provides
       thread safe variants of each explanation function.

RELEASE NOTES
       This section details the various features and bug fixes of the various
       releases.  For excruciating and complete detail, and also credits for
       those of you who have generously sent me suggestions and bug reports,
       see the etc/CHANGES.* files.

   Version 0.5 (2009-Jan-03)
       * A build problem on Debian sid has been fixed.

       * There is a new libexplain_system_success(3) function, that performs
       all that libexplain_system_success_or_die(3) performs, except that it
       does not call exit(2).

       * There is more i18n support.

       * A bug with the pkg-config(1) support has been fixed.

   Version 0.4 (2008-Dec-24)
       * Coverage now includes accept(2), bind(2), connect(2), dup2(2),
       fchown(2), fdopen(3), fpathconf(2), fputc(2), futimes(2),
       getaddrinfo(2), getcwd(2), getrlimit(2), listen(2), pathconf(2),
       putc(2), putchar(2), select(2).

       * Internationalization has been improved.

       * The thread safety of the code has been improved.

       * The code is now able to be compiled on OpenBSD.  The test suite still
       gives many false negatives, due to differences in strerror() results.

   Version 0.3 (2008-Nov-23)
       * Cover has been extended to include closedir(3), execve(2), ferror(3),
       fgetc(3), fgets(3), fork(2), fread(3), getc(3), gettimeofday(2),
       lchown(2), socket(2), system(3), utime(2), wait3(2), wait4(2), wait(2),
       waitpid(2),

       * More internationalization support has been added.

       * A bug has been fixed in the C++ insulation.

   Version 0.2 (2008-Nov-11)
       * Coverage now includes chmod(2), chown(2), dup(2), fchdir(2),
       fchmod(2), fstat(2), ftruncate(2), fwrite(3), mkdir(2), readdir(3),
       readlink(2), remove(3), rmdir(2) and truncate(2).

       * The lsof(1) command is used to obtain supplementary file information
       on those systems with limited /proc implementations.

       * The explanations now understand Linux capabilities.

   Version 0.1 (2008-Oct-26)
       First public release.
