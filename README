NAME
       libexplain - Explain errno values returned by libc functions

DESCRIPTION
       The libexplain package provides a library which may be used to explain
       Unix and Linux system call errors.  This will make your application's
       error messages much more informative to your users.

       The library is not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror(3), but it
       comes close.  Each system call has a dedicated libexplain function, for
       example
              fd = open(path, flags, mode);
              if (fd < 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_open(path, flags, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }
       If, for example, you were to try to open no-such-dir/some-file, you
       would see a message like
              open(pathname = "no-such-dir/some-file", flags = O_RDONLY)
              failed, No such file or directory (2, ENOENT) because there is
              no "no-such-dir" directory in the current directory

       The good new is that for each of these functions there is a wrapper
       function, in this case explain_open_or_die(3), that includes the above
       code fragment.  Adding good error reporting is as simple as using a
       different, but similarly named, function.  The library also provides
       thread safe variants of each explanation function.

RELEASE NOTES
       This section details the various features and bug fixes of the various
       releases.  For excruciating and complete detail, and also credits for
       those of you who have generously sent me suggestions and bug reports,
       see the etc/CHANGES.* files.

   Version 0.14 (2009-Jul-19)
       * Coverage now includes another 29 system calls: accept4(2), acct(2),
       adjtime(3), adjtimex(2), chroot(2), dirfd(3), eventfd(2), fflush(3),
       fileno(3), flock(2), fstatfs(2), ftime(3), getgroups(2),
       gethostname(2), kill(2), nice(2), pread(2), pwrite(2), sethostname(2),
       signalfd(2), strdup(3), strtod(3), strtof(3), strtol(3), strtold(3),
       strtoll(3), strtoul(3), strtoull(3), and timerfd_create(2).  A total of
       110 system calls are now supported

       * The ./configure script no longer demands lsof(1).  The Linux
       libexplain code doesn't need lsof(1).  On systems not supported by
       lsof(1), the error messages aren't quite as useful, but libexplain
       still works.

       * There is now an explain_*_on_error function for each system call,
       each reports errors but still returns the original return value to the
       caller.

   Version 0.13 (2009-May-17)
       * The web site now links to a number of services provided by
       SourceForge.

       * Several problems have been fixed with compiling libexplain on 64-bit
       systems.

   Version 0.12 (2009-May-04)
       * A build problem has been fixed on hosts that didn't need to do
       anything special for large file support.

   Version 0.11 (2009-Mar-29)
       * The current directory is replaced in messages with an absolute path
       in cases where the user's idea of the current directory may differ from
       that of the current process.

   Version 0.10 (2009-Mar-24)
       * The name prefix on all of the library functions has been changed from
       "libexplain_" to just "explain_".  This was the most requested change.
       You will need to change your code and recompile.  Apologies for the
       inconvenience.

   Version 0.9 (2009-Feb-27)
       * Two false negatives in the tests have been fixed.

       * The ./configure script now explicitly looks for bison(1), and
       complains if it cannot be found.

       * The socket(7) address family is now decoded.

   Version 0.8 (2009-Feb-14)
       * A problem with the Debian packaging has been fixed.

       * The decoding of IPv4 sockaddr structs has been improved.

   Version 0.7 (2009-Feb-10)
       * Coverage has been extended to include getsockopt(2), getpeername(2),
       getsockname(2) and setsockopt(2).

       * Build problems on Debian Sid have been fixed.

       * More magnetic tape ioctl controls, from operating systems other than
       Linux, have been added.

   Version 0.6 (2009-Jan-16)
       * Coverage has been extended to include execvp(3), ioctl(2), malloc(3),
       pclose(3), pipe(2), popen(3) and realloc(3) system calls.

       * The coverage for ioctl(2) includes linux console controls, magnetic
       tape controls, socket controls, and terminal controls.

       * A false negative from test 31 has been fixed.

   Version 0.5 (2009-Jan-03)
       * A build problem on Debian sid has been fixed.

       * There is a new explain_system_success(3) function, that performs all
       that explain_system_success_or_die(3) performs, except that it does not
       call exit(2).

       * There is more i18n support.

       * A bug with the pkg-config(1) support has been fixed.

   Version 0.4 (2008-Dec-24)
       * Coverage now includes accept(2), bind(2), connect(2), dup2(2),
       fchown(2), fdopen(3), fpathconf(2), fputc(2), futimes(2),
       getaddrinfo(2), getcwd(2), getrlimit(2), listen(2), pathconf(2),
       putc(2), putchar(2), select(2).

       * Internationalization has been improved.

       * The thread safety of the code has been improved.

       * The code is now able to be compiled on OpenBSD.  The test suite still
       gives many false negatives, due to differences in strerror(3) results.

   Version 0.3 (2008-Nov-23)
       * Cover has been extended to include closedir(3), execve(2), ferror(3),
       fgetc(3), fgets(3), fork(2), fread(3), getc(3), gettimeofday(2),
       lchown(2), socket(2), system(3), utime(2), wait3(2), wait4(2), wait(2),
       waitpid(2),

       * More internationalization support has been added.

       * A bug has been fixed in the C++ insulation.

   Version 0.2 (2008-Nov-11)
       * Coverage now includes chmod(2), chown(2), dup(2), fchdir(2),
       fchmod(2), fstat(2), ftruncate(2), fwrite(3), mkdir(2), readdir(3),
       readlink(2), remove(3), rmdir(2) and truncate(2).

       * The lsof(1) command is used to obtain supplementary file information
       on those systems with limited /proc implementations.

       * The explanations now understand Linux capabilities.

   Version 0.1 (2008-Oct-26)
       First public release.
