NAME
       libexplain - Explain errno values returned by libc functions

DESCRIPTION
       The libexplain package provides a library which may be used to explain
       Unix and Linux system call errors.  This will make your application's
       error messages much more informative to your users.

       The library is not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror(3), but it
       comes close.  Each system call has a dedicated libexplain function, for
       example
              fd = open(path, flags, mode);
              if (fd < 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", libexplain_open(path, flags, mode));
                  exit(1);
              }
       If, for example, you were to try to open no-such-dir/some-file, you
       would see a message like
              open("no-such-dir/some-file", O_RDONLY) failed, No such file or
              directory (2, ENOENT) because directory "no-such-dir" does not
              exist

       The library also provides thread safe variants of each function.
