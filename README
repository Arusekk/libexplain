NAME
       libexplain - Explain errno values returned by libc functions

DESCRIPTION
       The libexplain package provides a library which may be used to explain
       Unix and Linux system call errors.  This will make your application's
       error messages much more informative to your users.

       The library is not quite a drop-in replacement for strerror(3), but it
       comes close.  Each system call has a dedicated libexplain function, for
       example
              fd = open(path, flags, mode);
              if (fd < 0)
              {
                  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", explain_open(path, flags, mode));
                  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
              }
       If, for example, you were to try to open no-such-dir/some-file, you
       would see a message like
              open(pathname = "no-such-dir/some-file", flags = O_RDONLY)
              failed, No such file or directory (2, ENOENT) because there is
              no "no-such-dir" directory in the current directory

       The good new is that for each of these functions there is a wrapper
       function, in this case explain_open_or_die(3), that includes the above
       code fragment.  Adding good error reporting is as simple as using a
       different, but similarly named, function.  The library also provides
       thread safe variants of each explanation function.

       Coverage includes 162 system calls and 444 ioctl requests.

   Tutorial Documentation
       There is a paper available in PDF format
       (http://libexplain.sourceforge.net/lca2010/lca2010.pdf) that describes
       the library and how to use LibExplain.  The paper can also be accessed
       as explain_lca2010(1), which also appears in the reference manual (see
       below).

RELEASE NOTES
       This section details the various features and bug fixes of the various
       releases.  For excruciating and complete detail, and also credits for
       those of you who have generously sent me suggestions and bug reports,
       see the etc/CHANGES.* files.

       Coverage includes 162 system calls and 444 ioctl requests.

   Version 0.32 (2010-Jun-22)
       * Explanations are now available for errors reported by the mmap(2),
         munmap(2) and utimes(2) system calls.

       * A number of false negatives for tests on some less common
         architectures have been fixed.

       * Some build problems relating to ioctl(2) support have been fixed.

       * A bug has been fixed in the libexplain/output.h file, it was missing
         the C++ insulation.

   Version 0.31 (2010-May-01)
       * A number of build problems have been fixed.

   Version 0.30 (2010-Apr-28)
       * Several test false negatives have been fixed, on various Debian
       architectures.

   Version 0.29 (2010-Apr-25)
       * A number of build problems, discovered by the Debian build farm, have
       been fixed.  Who would of thought that there could be some much
       inconsistency between Linux architectures?

   Version 0.28 (2010-Apr-19)
       * Several architecture-specific build problems, found by the Debian
       build farm, have been fixed.

   Version 0.27 (2010-Apr-17)
       * Several architecture-specific build problems, found by the Debian
       build farm, have been fixed.

   Version 0.26 (2010-Apr-06)
       * A build problem has been fixed on systems where va_list is not
       compaitible with const void *

       * This change set removes the unused-result warning form
       explain_lseek_or_die, because it is very common to ignore the result.

       * Explaiantions are now available for errors reported by the
       socketpair(2) system call.

   Version 0.25 (2010-Mar-22)
       * Portability of the code has been improved.

       * The explain(3) man page now mentions AC_SYS_LARGEFILE in the building
       requirements.

       * Coverage now includes the fprintf(3), printf(3), snprintf(3),
       sprintf(3), vfprintf(3), vprintf(3), vsnprintf(3) and vsprintf(3)
       system calls.

   Version 0.24 (2010-Mar-03)
       * It is now possible to redirected libexplain output.  For example, it
       is now possible to redirect all output to syslog(3).

       * Coverage now includes the fstatvfs(2) and statvfs(2) system call.

       * A number of problems found while building and testing on Solaris have
       been fixed.

   Version 0.23 (2010-Feb-21)
       * This change set fixes a problem discovered by the Debian build farm.
       It turns out that on alpha architecture, you can't disambiguate the
       FIBMAP vs BMP_IOCTL case in the pre-processor.  The code now uses a
       disambiguate function.
       Debian: Closes: 570671

       * This change set modifies explain_string_buffer_putc_quoted to build
       the octal representation itself, because too many system get %03o and
       %3.3o wrong, and inconsistently.

   Version 0.22 (2010-Feb-12)
       * This change set fixes a false negative found by the Debian automated
       build system.

   Version 0.21 (2010-Feb-09)
       * Explanations are now availaible for errors reported by the fpurge(3),
       getw(3) and putw(3) system calls.

       * Some build problems have been fixed.

   Version 0.20 (2010-Jan-20)
       * Several lintian warnings relating to the man pages have been fixed.

       * The LIBEXPLAION_OPTIONS environment variable now inderstands a new
       symbolic-mode-bits=true option.  It defaults to false, for shorter
       error explanations.

       * There is a new explain_lca2010(1) man page.  This is a gentle
       introduction to libexplain, and the paper accompanying my LCA 2010
       talk.

       * When process ID (pid) values are printed, they are now accompanied by
       the name of the process executable, when available.

       * Numerous build bugs and niggles have been fixed.

       * Explanations are now available for errors reported by the execlp(3),
       fdopendir(3), feof(3), fgetpos(3), fputs(3), fseek(3), fsetpos(3),
       fsync(2), ftell(3), mkdtemp(3), mknod(2), mkostemp(3), mkstemp(3),
       mktemp(3), putenv(3), puts(3), raise(3), setbuf(3), setbuffer(3),
       setenv(3), setlinebuf(3), setvbuf(3), stime(2), tempnam(3), tmpfile(3),
       tmpnam(3), ungetc(3), unsetenv(3) and vfork(2) system calls.

       * The ioctl requests from linux/sockios.h, linux/ext2_fs.h,
       linux/if_eql.h, PPP, linux/lp.h, and linux/vt.h are now understood.
       Several of the ioctl explanations have been improved.

   Version 0.19 (2009-Sep-07)
       * The ioctl requests from linux/hdreg.h are now understood.

       * Some build problems on Debian Lenny have been fixed.

   Version 0.18 (2009-Sep-05)
       * More ioctl requesrs are un derstood.

       * Explanations are now availaible for errors reported by the
       tcsendbreak(3), tcsetattr(3), tcgetattr(3), tcflush(3), tcdrain(3),
       system calls.

   Version 0.17 (2009-Sep-03)
       * Explanations are now available for errors reported by the telldir(3)
       system call.

       * A number of Linux build problems have been fixed.

       * Explanations for a number of corner-cases of the open(2) system call
       have been improved, where flags values interact with file types and
       mount options.

       * A number of BSD build problems have been fixed.

       * More ioctl(2) commands are understood.

       * A bug has been fixed in the way absolute symbolic links are processed
       by the path_resolution code.

   Version 0.16 (2009-Aug-03)
       * The EROFS and ENOMEDIUM explanations now greatly improved.

       * A number of build problems and false negatives have been fixed on
       x86_64 architecture.

       * The Linux floppy disk and CD-ROM ioctl requests are now supported.

       * Explanations are now available for the errors reported by the
       getdomainname(2), readv(2), setdomainname(2), ustat(2) and writev(2)
       system calls.

   Version 0.15 (2009-Jul-26)
       * A number of build errors and warnings on amd64 have been fixed.  The
       problems were only detectable on 64-bit systems.

   Version 0.14 (2009-Jul-19)
       * Coverage now includes another 29 system calls: accept4(2), acct(2),
       adjtime(3), adjtimex(2), chroot(2), dirfd(3), eventfd(2), fflush(3),
       fileno(3), flock(2), fstatfs(2), ftime(3), getgroups(2),
       gethostname(2), kill(2), nice(2), pread(2), pwrite(2), sethostname(2),
       signalfd(2), strdup(3), strtod(3), strtof(3), strtol(3), strtold(3),
       strtoll(3), strtoul(3), strtoull(3), and timerfd_create(2).  A total of
       110 system calls are now supported

       * The ./configure script no longer demands lsof(1).  The Linux
       libexplain code doesn't need lsof(1).  On systems not supported by
       lsof(1), the error messages aren't quite as useful, but libexplain
       still works.

       * There is now an explain_*_on_error function for each system call,
       each reports errors but still returns the original return value to the
       caller.

   Version 0.13 (2009-May-17)
       * The web site now links to a number of services provided by
       SourceForge.

       * Several problems have been fixed with compiling libexplain on 64-bit
       systems.

   Version 0.12 (2009-May-04)
       * A build problem has been fixed on hosts that didn't need to do
       anything special for large file support.

   Version 0.11 (2009-Mar-29)
       * The current directory is replaced in messages with an absolute path
       in cases where the user's idea of the current directory may differ from
       that of the current process.

   Version 0.10 (2009-Mar-24)
       * The name prefix on all of the library functions has been changed from
       "libexplain_" to just "explain_".  This was the most requested change.
       You will need to change your code and recompile.  Apologies for the
       inconvenience.

   Version 0.9 (2009-Feb-27)
       * Two false negatives in the tests have been fixed.

       * The ./configure script now explicitly looks for bison(1), and
       complains if it cannot be found.

       * The socket(7) address family is now decoded.

   Version 0.8 (2009-Feb-14)
       * A problem with the Debian packaging has been fixed.

       * The decoding of IPv4 sockaddr structs has been improved.

   Version 0.7 (2009-Feb-10)
       * Coverage has been extended to include getsockopt(2), getpeername(2),
       getsockname(2) and setsockopt(2).

       * Build problems on Debian Sid have been fixed.

       * More magnetic tape ioctl controls, from operating systems other than
       Linux, have been added.

   Version 0.6 (2009-Jan-16)
       * Coverage has been extended to include execvp(3), ioctl(2), malloc(3),
       pclose(3), pipe(2), popen(3) and realloc(3) system calls.

       * The coverage for ioctl(2) includes linux console controls, magnetic
       tape controls, socket controls, and terminal controls.

       * A false negative from test 31 has been fixed.

   Version 0.5 (2009-Jan-03)
       * A build problem on Debian sid has been fixed.

       * There is a new explain_system_success(3) function, that performs all
       that explain_system_success_or_die(3) performs, except that it does not
       call exit(2).

       * There is more i18n support.

       * A bug with the pkg-config(1) support has been fixed.

   Version 0.4 (2008-Dec-24)
       * Coverage now includes accept(2), bind(2), connect(2), dup2(2),
       fchown(2), fdopen(3), fpathconf(2), fputc(2), futimes(2),
       getaddrinfo(2), getcwd(2), getrlimit(2), listen(2), pathconf(2),
       putc(2), putchar(2), select(2).

       * Internationalization has been improved.

       * The thread safety of the code has been improved.

       * The code is now able to be compiled on OpenBSD.  The test suite still
       gives many false negatives, due to differences in strerror(3) results.

   Version 0.3 (2008-Nov-23)
       * Cover has been extended to include closedir(3), execve(2), ferror(3),
       fgetc(3), fgets(3), fork(2), fread(3), getc(3), gettimeofday(2),
       lchown(2), socket(2), system(3), utime(2), wait3(2), wait4(2), wait(2),
       waitpid(2),

       * More internationalization support has been added.

       * A bug has been fixed in the C++ insulation.

   Version 0.2 (2008-Nov-11)
       * Coverage now includes chmod(2), chown(2), dup(2), fchdir(2),
       fchmod(2), fstat(2), ftruncate(2), fwrite(3), mkdir(2), readdir(3),
       readlink(2), remove(3), rmdir(2) and truncate(2).

       * The lsof(1) command is used to obtain supplementary file information
       on those systems with limited /proc implementations.

       * The explanations now understand Linux capabilities.

   Version 0.1 (2008-Oct-26)
       First public release.
